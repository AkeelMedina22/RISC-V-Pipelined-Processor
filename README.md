# RISC-V Pipelined Processor

This is a verilog code for a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V Processor with forwarding, stalling, and flushing functionality. Here is the circuit diagramme of the processor.

This is the semester project for the course Computer Architecture at Habib University. The instruction memory module is preloaded with Bubble Sort, implemented in RISC-V Assembly Language. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your web browser using EDA Playground.

### Instructions

For simulation purposes, open a new playground and load the testbench.sv and design.sv files. In the tab for design.sv, add all other sv files in the repository. In the 'Tools and Simulator' tab, choose 'Mentor Questa 2020.1'. Do not specify a run time.
